* a standard container is an object that stores other objects, and controls allocation and deallocation of those objects, while conforming to a well defined interface.

* The standard provides container type templates, each optimized for different use models, and all mostly sharing a common interface.

* categories:- 
1. sequentially accessed containers - used to model static and dynamic arrays, queues, stacks, heaps, linked lists and trees.
2. associatively accessed containers - used to model associative arrays and sets.
