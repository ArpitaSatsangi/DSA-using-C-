Race conditions, if it’s multi-threaded. Memory coherency errors also if it’s multi-threaded / using shared variables 
(so make sure you’re using locks properly, EVEN for reads). 
Make sure you are initializing your variables: they’re more likely to be 0 on debug builds; 
on an optimized build, you’re more likely to get uninitialized variables containing random stack values.
