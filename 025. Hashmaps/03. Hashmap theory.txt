In computer science, a hash map, often called a hash table, is a common data structure that offers effective key-value pair storing and retrieval. 
It is an attractive choice for several applications since it provides constant-time complexity for average-case scenarios. 

# Overview of a hash map
A hashmap is an associative container that stores elements in a key-value format. 
It utilizes a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, known as a bucket. 
This hashing technique allows for fast retrieval of values based on their associated keys. 
In C++, hash maps are implemented using the unordered_map container class from the Standard Template Library (STL).

# Hash function
The hash function is a crucial component of a hashmap that takes a key as input and returns an index within the range of the hashmapâ€™s underlying array. 
An ideal hash function should evenly distribute keys across the available indices, reducing collisions (when two keys map to the same index). 
The unordered_map class in C++ provides a default hash function for primitive types, 
but custom hash functions can be defined for user-defined types.

# Collision resolution
Collisions occur when multiple keys generate the same hash value and map to the same index in the array. 
Various collision resolution techniques are employed to handle such scenarios. 
The two primary approaches are chaining and open addressing. 
Chaining involves creating a linked list at each bucket to store multiple key-value pairs, 
while open addressing aims to find alternative locations within the hash map to store colliding elements.
